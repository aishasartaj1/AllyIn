Subject: Vector Store Integration - Notes

Hi,

We’ve deployed Qdrant on our staging cluster.  
Please confirm once your embedding pipeline is pushing vectors correctly — we’ll run similarity tests using the audit reports corpus.

Also note: Neo4j Sandbox is live for knowledge graph ingestion.

Regards,  
Sr. Data Architect
